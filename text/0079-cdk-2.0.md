# Summary

This RFC details the strategy for building and releasing v2 of the AWS CDK, in addition to changes to tooling required
to support this strategy. For details on the specific features themselves, refer to the corresponding RFCs.

# Motivation

Since the CDK was announcned as "generally available", the team has tried to limit breaking changes for users. However,
a handful of features have emerged that the core team believes will make the CDK significantly simpler to use. These
changes require a v2 release to signal to users that code changes may be required for adoption.

The main change of note is to consolidate all of the aws service construct libraries into a single package. The
motivation for this change is detailed in [the corresponding RFC](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs/issues/6).

The core motivation of this proposal is to detail the plan required to release this change while continuing to support
users referencing the v1 modules. In short, we want to make sure users have plenty of time to transition their code to
using the new module structure and make that transition as easy as possible.

# Scope

Since this is the first major version release since we announced General Availability of the AWS CDK, we will pay close
attention to which changes are scoped in for this release. The main criteria used to determine whether a change is
suitable for inclusion are:

- the change _requires_ breaking existing customers of the changed API or feature
  - a migration should be possible without incurring replacement of existing resources
- the change addresses a well documented customer pain point
- the change has had the due diligence done:
  - implications of the change are well documented
  - an implementation strategy is documented

## Changes considered for v2 inclusion

- The following changes will be included, or are candidates for inclusion:

* The following changes were scoped out because they can be achieved by introducing a new, fixed API, while deprecating
  the current one. If done _before_ v2 is released, this effectively means `v2` will only retain the new and improved
  API:

* The following changes were excluded because they would likely make migration of existing applications from v1 to v2
  impossible, as they would likely lead to widespread replacement of existing resources (typically, because a new
  logical ID would be assigned to those):

# Detailed Design

## Overview

The development and release of v2 will be done in several key steps, detailed in the following sections:

1. [Create a v2 development branch by forking v1](#forking-v2-out-of-v1)
1. [Make the necessary code changes to implement all features scoped in for v2](#feature-implementation)
1. [Prepare documentation updates](#documentation-updates)
1. [Publish and advertise _experimental_ pre-releases to the usual package registries](#prerelease-publishing)
1. [Perform miscelaneous construct library maintenance tasks](#construct-library-maintenance-tasks)
1. [Announce developer preview and document v1 maintenance plan](#developer-preview)
1. [Listen to customer feedback and adjust as needed](#feedback-phase)
1. [Announce General Availability](#general-availability)
1. [Clean up dead code](#clean-up)
1. [Monitor adoption of the new version](#monitoring-adoption)
1. [Deprecation of v1](#deprecation-of-v1)

## Forking v2 out of v1

The forking point will be achieved by cutting a new `next` branch from the current tip of the `master` branch. The
repository-wide `version` configuration will be updated to `2.0.0-alpha` (the pre-release identifier could be
different). A continuous integration pipeline will be configured on this new branch, so that pull requests can be
automatically validated.

As long as the codebases have not diverged too much, it should be possible to continue forward-porting new developments
on top of the `next` branch by simply cherry-picking new commits from the `master` branch. Alternatively, it might be
possible to simply periodically merge `master` into `next`.

As the codebases grow further appart, manual work may be required in order to forward-port feature work merged in
`master`. As a consequence we will strive to keep divergences to a minimum for as long as possible.

## Feature Implementation

This section provides detailed plans for implementing the features that were scoped in for this new major version.

### Removal of `@deprecated` APIs

The definition of `@deprecated` in the CDK specifies that annotated APIs will be removed in the next major version
release. Consequently, we will systematically remove all `@deprecated` APIs from the codebase upon cutting a new major
version.

This task is expected to be easy to carry out by hand. Searching the codebase for `@deprecated` and deleting the
annotated code, as well as any private function that is no longer used. In the event non-`@deprecated` code is found to
depend on `@deprecated` code, the implementation in `master` will be fixed to no longer defer into the `@deprecated`
feature, and that fix will be forward-ported into the `next` branch in the exact same way that other changes are.

### Resetting v1 feature flags

When developing new behaviors that are incompatible with previous ones, feature flags were introduced to allow customers
control of when they migrate over to the _new behavior_. However, when a new major version release is issued, the _new
behavior_ becomes the _only behavior_.

In order to reduce the codebase divergence between `master` and `next` (in order to minimize the amount of manual work
involved in forward-porting features on `next`), existing feature flags must be made version-aware, such that they are
forcefully enabled when the current version is greater then `2.0.0-0`.

The actual removal of code paths that support the _old behavior_ will be deferred to _after_ the new major version has
reached _General Availability_.

### Monolithic Packaging

The AWS Construct Library will be released as a single artifact, instead of a collection of more than 100 libraries. The
`monocdk-experiment` package has the tools necessary to re-package the existing _hypermodular_ libraries into a single
packaging. Re-using that same process will allow keeping the difference between `master` and `next` as constrained as
possible (reducing the need for manual intervention in forward-porting features).

Consequently, the `monocdk-experiment` package will be renamed so that it is published and advertised as
`@aws-cdk/stdlib` on the `master` branch. Availability of this library as part of CDK v1 is going to provide customers
with a stepping stone to begin migrating their applications to CDK v2.

Additionally, all modules that are re-packaged as part of `@aws-cdk/stdlib` will be marked as `"private": true` in the
`next` branch, making these available _only_ via `@aws-cdk/stdlib` in CDK v2.

## Documentation Updates

Before formally announcing the availability of CDK v2 for early adopters, a documentation source must be availble to
facilitate use of the new repository. The minimum bar should be availability of an API reference documentation for the
v2 codebase that is usable.

At the same time, the work to update the [AWS CDK User Guide] should be scoped and planned out. The updates to the User
Guide must also include a migration guide to help developers move from CDK v1 over to v2. Special attention will be
spent in ensuring the v2 release notes contain a clear and accurate summary of breaking changes and how users should
update their applications.

[aws cdk user guide]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html

## Prerelease Publishing

Once sufficient documentation is in place, and the framework-level changes have been implemented and integration tested,
we will be able to start promoting the upcoming new release and point early adopters to experimental builds of CDK v2.
This will allow gathering early feedback on the updated experience.

A prerelease announcement will be published, formally announcing our plan to release AWS CDK v2 in the near future. This
prerelease announcement should at least mention the following elements:

- A provisional list of breaking changes expected to be made to the _AWS Construct Library_ (`@aws-cdk/stdlib`) APIs
  during the [Construct Library Maintenance Tasks](#construct-library-maintenance-tasks) phase
- A finalized proposal for the CDK [v1 maintenance plan](#ongoing-maintenance-plan), and a call for developers to
  provide feedback on that
- A minimal migration guide for bravehearts who are inclined to try and migrate their existing (**non-production**)
  applications

## Construct Library Maintenance Tasks

Now that the v2 framework is in place, _AWS Construct Library_ owners (as well as third party contributors) will be
given some time to perform API-breaking maintenance tasks. The API-breaking changes should be limited to items that were
scoped out during the [Prerelease Publishing](#prerelease-publishing) phase and listed in the prerelease announcement,
however additional changes can be introduced if there is sufficient justification. All breaking changes (including those
planned in the prerelease announcement) will be documented in the release notes for each subsequent prerelease version,
per the standard process.

## Developer Preview

At the end of the [Construct Library Maintenance Tasks](#construct-library-maintenance-tasks) window, a moratorium on
breaking changes in v2 will be declared, as the codebase is thoroughly tested and vetted. At the end of the vetting
period, and once known issues have been addressed, CDK v2 can be declared _Developer Preview_.

Once the _Developer Preview_ has been declared, breaking changes will only be allowed if they are motivated by
overwhelming customer feedback or the absence of alternate solutions to fix a well-documented pain point introduced by
v2 changes.

## Feedback Phase

During _Developer Preview_, we will keep listening to customer feedback and address bugs as they are discovered. The CDK
[version reporting] dataset will be used to track adoption of the new version. We will encourage customers to provide
feedback on the upcoming new release using a pinned GitHub issue, and possibly other means.

[version reporting]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/tools.html

## General Availability

After the _Developer Preview_ has been sufficiently vetted, a timeline for _General Availability_ will be agreed upon by
maintainers. The _General Availability_ checkist includes the following items:

- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] API Reference Documentation
  - [ ] User Guide
  - [ ] Migration Guide
  - [ ] Final maintenance plan for v1
- [ ] Quality Assurance
  - [ ] Complete suite of integration tests
  - [ ] Examples built and tested against v2
- [ ] No v1 feature is missing from v2 (unless it was deprecated in v1)

Once the criteria have been satisfied, the high-level procedure for officially releasing CDK v2 is:

1. Create a new `v1` branch from the `master` branch
   1. Configure GitHub branch protection on `v1` as appropriate
   1. Deploy CI/CD infrastructure on top of `v1`
1. Make `next` the new `master` branch:
   1. Force-push `next` on `master`
   1. Delete `next` and all related CI/CD infrastructure
1. Perform a _normal_ release
1. Ceremoniously annouce CDK v2 is _Generally Available_, and repeat the v1 maintenance plan

## Clean Up

Now that the new major version has been declared _Generally Available_, the previous major (`v1`) has entered
_maintenance_ mode. Forward porting is no longer exercised: instead, bug fixes on `master` will be back-ported to `v1`
when necessary. This means `master` can diverge more significantly from `v1` than in earler stages of the process.

The definition of `v1` feature flags and the code paths supporthing the _old behavior_ of those can be deleted.

## Monitoring Adoption

We will keep an eye on adoption of CDK v2 thanks to the [version reporting] dataset. Should adoption pick up too slowly,
actions will be taken to understand the causes for slow adoption and identify opportunities to provide additional
tooling to remove roadblocks and facilitate migration.

[version reporting]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/tools.html

## Deprecation of v1

Based on the v1 maintenance plan, feature development is to stop on CDK v1, as only bugs reported against CDK v1 are to
be fixed. Back-porting of features is not necessary, although the community is still welcome to back-port features.

New GitHub labels will be added to differentiate bugs affecting `v1`, `v2` or both. The triaging process will need to be
adjusted to include a determination of whether a bug fix against CDK v1 needs forward-porting to v2 or vice-versa. A
similar provision applies to pull-requests, as only the following should be accepted against v1:

- Features that facilitate migration to v2
- Features that are back-ported from v2

# AWS CDK Maintenance Policy

Customers of the CDK must be able to rely on the perenity of major version releases. On the other hand, maintaining
multiple major versions at the same time can be challenging, especially if feature work is expected ot happen on both
branches. Our goal is to minimize the cost of maintaining multiple major versions at the same time, while enabling
customers to migrate to a new major version release at their own pace.

To this effect, we define the following life-cycle stages for libraries and tools (later on referenced generically as
_software_) that are part of the CDK ecosystem:

- **Developer Preview**: During this phase, software is not supported, should not be used in production environments,
  and are meant for early access and feedback purposes only. It is possible for future releases to introduce breaking
  changes. Once AWS identifies a release to be a stable product, it may mark it as a _Release Candidate_. _Release
  Candidates_ are ready for _General Availability_ unless significant bugs emerge, and will receive full AWS support.
- **Full Support**: During this phase, software is fully supported. AWS will provide regular releases that include new
  features, support for new services, API updates for existing services, as well as bug and security fixes.
- **Maintenance Announcement**: AWS will make a public announcement at least 6 months before software enters the
  **Maintenance** phase. During this period, software will continue to be fully supported. Typically, this announcement
  happens at the same time as the next major version is introduced.
- **Maintenance**: During this phase, AWS limits releases to address critical bug fixes and security issues only.
  Software will no longer receive API updates for new or existing services, or be updated to support new regions. The
  **Maintenance** phase has a default duration of 12 months, unless otherwise specified as part of the **Maintenance
  Announcement**.
- **End-of-Support**: This phase starts at the scheduled end of the **Maintenance** phase. Software that has reached
  **End-of-Support** will no longer receive updates or new releases. Previously published releases will continue to be
  available via public package managers and the code will remain accessible on GitHub. The GitHub repository may be
  archived. Use of software that has reached **End-of-Support** is done at the user's discretion. We recommend users
  upgrade to the latest major version (the release in **Full Support** phase).

Here is a visual illystration of the major version life-cycle (timelines are purely illustrative):

# Rationale and Alternatives

## Rationale

The main motivation for moving forward with a v2 release now is the desire to start moving towards the single module
structure. The current multi module structure is known to cause a lot of confusion for users. For more details on why
aws-cdk is moving to a single package, see the [MonoCDK RFC](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs/issues/6).

This belief that releasing a single package will make user's lives easier is countered by a strong desire to limit the
exposure of users to breaking changes. Though the aws-cdk is relatively young, one of the core tenants of the project is
stability. Major version upgrades are an important part of building and maintaining libraries. However, limiting the
cost of breaking changes included in major releases is important. It isn't in the interest of the project to drop a new
major version, immediately stop supporting the previous version, and leave the onus on the user to "catch up".

Therefore, a major part of the motivation to perform this work is to establish a framework for releasing new major
versions of the cdk in a controlled and standardized way. Establishing standards and tools to automatically handle
deprecations, feature flag resets, and pre-release versioning will allow the core team and contributors to leverage
these to better control breakage. The path to introduce a breaking change is then a lot more clear.

First we ask, "can this be implemented behind a feature flag"? If so, that's usually the answer. Build tooling tells us
when feature flags can be removed and warns users when it has happened. Migration path to new behavior has to be
considered and should be documented clearly at the time the flag is created. This goes in the migration guide of the
next major version.

If it can't be implemented behind a feature flag, we ask "can a new code path be defined and the old one deprecated?".
Once again, migration path is considered and documented and it goes into the next major version migration guide.

If the migration path is too painful in either situation, can it be reduced somehow? Can it be automated? etc...

The desire to move forward with the change in packaging strategy has brought the need for these tools and procedures to
the forefront.

## Alternatives

The most notable alternative to releasing a new major version, is basically to not. This could be done a couple of ways.

The first is not moving forward with the packaging change at all. For the argument against that, see the
[MonoCDK RFC](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs/issues/6).

The second is to simply release the new module, `@aws-cdk/stdlib` locked to the same `1.x.x` version that the other
modules are currently locked to. In fact, that is the first stage of the release process, its just under the name
`monocdk-experiment`. This was a low cost way for the dev team, contributors, and users to experiment with the new
structure before investing too much towards it.

Regardless, the point of using this change to push towards a v2 release, is that the single package structure is "the
new cdk". Meaning, the long term plan is to only release the `@aws-cdk/stdlib` package and no longer publish the other
`@aws-cdk/` namespaced ones. The [MonoCDK RFC](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs/issues/6) has more info on the
problems currently experienced by users caused by the current packaging strategy and these problems will always exist
unless we stop supporting the `@aws-cdk/` packages.

Since we want to eventually supplant the current module structure with the new one, semver says we have to do it with
the release of a major version.

# Adoption Strategy

All users will perform the following to adopt CDK v2

1. Update Dependencies - Changing from referencing the old `@aws-cdk/` packages to the new `@aws-cdk/stdlib` package in
   the corresponding target language's package manifest (`package.json`, `.csproj`, `pom.xml`, `setup.py`, etc...).
1. Update Imports - Since the current module structure is being changed in certain languages, import statements in
   user's code will need to change accordingly:
   - In TypeScript, this can be automated by a tool such as `@monocdk-experiment/import-rewriter`
   - In Python, manual replacement of import statements migth be necessary
   - In .NET languages (C#, F#, ...) and Java, the namespace structure from CDK v1 will be retained, removing the need
     for any code change

Users will naturally have to make additional changes when upgrading if they are relying on deprecated APIs or _old
behaviors_ from feature flags that are being removed. A [migration guide](#migration-guide) will be written with details
about each individual feature flag and deprecated API that users may need to handle differently when upgrading.

# Future Possibilities

As our first major version post v1, this sets the tone for others going forward. The v2 release is looking to be
relatively painless for users to adopt. The only code change required, if any at all, should be completely automated.
The challenge for the future is to maintain that experience whenever possible, and wherever it isn't, give users plenty
of time and warning to change their code and provide details about a reasonable path to do so without interruptions to
their existing cloud resources.
